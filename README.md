machine learning project for microarray gene expression

## orginasation of the repository 
In our github repository you can find the different scripts for every part of the project. We decided to split up into different parts to maintain a better structure and to have a better overview of all the code we have written for every part of the project. The report will contain a discussion of the results and observation we obtained from the code. Under this README file u will be able to find more comments and approaches for every part of the coding process.
